# Suddoku_Game
This project implements a backtracking-based Sudoku solver in C++. It takes a 9x9 Sudoku grid with some pre-filled numbers (and zeros representing empty cells), and recursively fills in the grid by checking the safety of each digit placement according to Sudoku rules.

ðŸ’¡ Features:
Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

Checks for safe placement of digits in rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.

Prints the solved Sudoku grid, if a solution exists.

ðŸ§® Algorithm Used:
Backtracking: Try placing digits from 1 to 9 in each empty cell, backtrack if constraints are violated.
